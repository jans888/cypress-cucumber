How would you test specifically the search feature on the tiketa platform? Suggest
mechanism/layer rather than test cases.

Frontend and backend parts can be used for Search feature testing.
Firstly, ticket results can be checked in DB through API call or directly in DB, and then results from DB can be compared with results in UI.
Also, the Search feature can be tested from the performance perspective. 
For example, how results are appeared in UI, if the website visits 100, 1000, or more visitors at one time.
The search feature can be tested on different browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Electron with different viewports settings.
Also, endpoints, which are consumed by UI can be tested and then check, does the date appears properly.



How would you set up for testing this feature with automation in mind?

To prepare the testing with automation the following main points need to be implemented:
1. Hardcoded selectors need to be avoided. All selectors should be located outside test cases and should be stored in separate page object files.
2. Environment's hosts, user credentials, and viewports settings need to be parametrized, to have the possibility to use it in the command line with the native test runner.
For example, in cypress, the following command can be used where username and host are parametrized.
cypress run --headed --browser chrome --env username=${username} --env host=${host} -e TAGS=\"@searchFeature\""
3. Execution of these test cases can be implemented to the existing CI/CD. 
If not, automation execution of test cases can be implemented using Jenkins and the native test runner of the test automation framework.
